# Busy-Beaver-of-18
The smallest known value of n for which the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">busy beaver function</a>, BB(n), is greater than <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham%27s_number">Graham's number</a> is 18. This was achieved on a <a href="https://googology.wikia.org/wiki/User_blog:Wythagoras/The_nineteenth_Busy_Beaver_number_is_greater_than_Graham%27s_Number!">blog post</a> in which the author designed an 18-state turing machine which outputs with more than Graham's number 1's on the tape. Their turing machine can be found in the txt file in this repository. I made a simple visualization of the computation.
